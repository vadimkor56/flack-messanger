# Flack

It is a simple messanger where you can send text messages, files and create channels.

Files:
- app.py - flask application with flask-socketio
- templates/index.html - main page with css and js included

Personal touch:
- Ability to send several files (files are send to the server via ftp)
- Showing to the users who is typing to the channel
